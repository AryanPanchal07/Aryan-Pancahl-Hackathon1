                            <p class="leading-relaxed">A video explainer on Vitamin C, its benefits and why researchers are studying its benefits to fight COVID-19
                            
                            Vitamin C has lately been of interest to researchers in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Large doses of
                            intravenous Vitamin C are being tried in COVID-19 critical patients on ventilators in China.
                            
                            Australian researchers reported that they did not find any benefit in using Vitamin C. But the U.S. is planning to try a
                            combination of Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Zinc and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 prevention.
                            
                            There is still no evidence to prove consuming a high amount of vitamin C is effective against coronavirus. According to
                            Chennai-based Nephrologist Dr. Rajan Ravichandran, caution is required in consuming mega doses of vitamins without
                            prescriptions, especially for long periods.
                            
                            Vitamin C or Ascorbic acid is a water-soluble essential nutrient. Being water-soluble, it is not stored in the body and requires daily intake.
                            It is a powerful antioxidant with an important role in controlling infections and promoting healing of wounds. Its many
                            functions include synthesis of collagen, chemical messengers in the brain and hormones.
                            
                            The source of Vitamin C is fruits and vegetables like oranges and lemons. After consumption, the absorbed Vitamin C is
                            metabolised in the body to oxalate and is removed by the kidneys.
                            
                            Large doses of Vitamin C have been used to improve the immunity and promote wound healing. Normally the body can cope
                            with this high dose by reducing the absorption and increasing the oxalate loss in urine. But in some people, the oxalate
                            can get deposited in the kidneys resulting in kidney failure. This is likely in patients with intestinal disorders and
                            pre-existing kidney disease.
                            
                            The daily requirement of Vitamin C is 90mg in adult males, 75mg for females which increases to 120 mg during pregnancy.
                            
                            Deficiency of Vitamin C is rare and but when it occurs, it is called scurvy. The deficiency can manifest with bleeding
                            gums, delayed wound healing, skin spots, hair loss and anaemia.  </p>

                            by your local health authority.
                            To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
                            Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
                            Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                            Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.
                            Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
                            Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
                            Stay home if you feel unwell.
                            If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.
                            Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects
                            you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
                            Masks
                            Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect
                            against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your
                            local health authority.</p>

                            <h2 class="font-medium title-font text-sm text-gray-900 mb-1 tracking-wider">Food And Nutritient Tips</h2>
                            <p class="leading-relaxed">5 healthy eating tips
                            
                            1. Keep up fruit and vegetable intake
                            
                            Purchasing, storing and cooking fresh vegetables can be challenging in a lockdown, especially when parents are advised
                            to limit trips outside of the home. But wherever possible, itâ€™s important to ensure children are still getting plenty of
                            fruit and vegetables in their diet.
                            
                            Whenever it is possible to get hold of fresh produce, do so. As well as being eaten fresh, fruits and vegetables can be
                            frozen where possible and will retain most of their nutrients and flavor. Using fresh vegetables to cook large batches
                            of soups, stews or other dishes will make them last longer and provide meal options for a few days. These can also be
                            frozen where possible and then quickly reheated.
                            
                            2. Swap in healthy dried or canned alternatives when fresh produce is not available
                            
                            Fresh produce is almost always the best option, but when it is not available there are plenty of healthy alternatives
                            that are easy to store and prepare.
                            
                            Canned beans and chickpeas, which provide an abundance of nutrients, can be stored for months or even years, and can be
                            included in meals in many ways. Canned oily fish such as sardines, mackerel and salmon are rich in protein, omega 3
                            fatty acids and a range of vitamins and minerals. These can be used cold in sandwiches, salads or pasta dishes, or
                            cooked as part of a warm meal.
                            
                            Canned vegetables, such as tomatoes, do tend to contain lower quantities of vitamins than fresh produce, but they are a
                            great fallback option when fresh produce or frozen vegetables are hard to come by.
                            
                            Dried goods like dried beans, pulses and grains such as lentils, split peas, rice, couscous or quinoa are also
                            nutritious, long-lasting options that are tasty, affordable and filling. Rolled oats cooked with milk or water can serve
                            as an excellent breakfast option, and can be spiced up with yoghurt, chopped fruits or raisins.
                            
                            3. Build up a stock of healthy snacks
                            
                            Children often need to eat a snack or two during the day to keep them going. Rather than giving kids sweets or salty
                            snacks, opt for healthier options like nuts, cheese, yoghurt (preferably unsweetened), chopped or dried fruits, boiled
                            eggs, or other locally available healthy options. These foods are nutritious, more filling, and help build healthy
                            eating habits that last a lifetime.
                            
                            4. Limit highly processed foods
                            
                            While using fresh produce may not always be possible, try to limit the amount of highly processed foods in your shopping
                            basket. Ready-to-eat meals, packaged snacks and desserts are often high in saturated fat, sugars and salt. If you do
                            purchase processed foods, look at the label and try to choose healthier options containing less of these substances. Try
                            to also avoid sugary drinks and instead drink lots of water. Adding fruits or vegetables like lemon, lime, cucumber
                            slices or berries to water is a great way to add an extra twist of flavor.
                            
                            5. Make cooking and eating a fun and meaningful part of your family routine
                            
                            Cooking and eating together is a great way to create healthy routines, strengthen family bonds and have fun. Wherever
                            you can, involve your children in food preparation â€“ small children can help with washing or sorting food items while
                            older children can take on more complex tasks and help to set the table.
                            
                            Try as much as possible to stick to fixed mealtimes as a family. Such structures and routine can help reduce anxiety for
                            children in these stressful situations.
                            
                            
                            Advice for breastfeeding children
                            
                            Breastmilk remains a great food for children between 6-24 months and beyond. Women with COVID-19 can continue to
                            breastfeed if they wish to do so. They should, however, practice respiratory hygiene during feeding, wearing a mask
                            where available; wash their hands before and after touching the baby; and routinely clean and disinfect surfaces they
                            have touched. If too unwell to breastfeed due to the virus or other complications, mothers should be supported to safely
                            provide newborns with breastmilk in any way possible.
                            Food hygiene tips during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak
                            
                            While at present there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with the transmission of coronavirus
                            disease (COVID-19), it may be possible that people can become infected by touching a surface or object contaminated by
                            the virus and then touching their face. The higher risk though, comes from being in close contact with other people
                            while food shopping or receiving a food delivery. As always, good hygiene is important when handling food to prevent any
                            food-borne illnesses.
                            
                            Remove any unnecessary packaging and dispose into a waste bin with a lid. Packaging like cans can be wiped clean with a
                            disinfectant before being opened or stored. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an
                            alcohol-based hand rub, immediately afterwards.
                            
                            Wash unpackaged produce, such as fruit and vegetables, thoroughly under running water.
                            
                            General food hygiene tips
                            
                            Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before preparing any food.
                            User separate chopping boards to prepare uncooked meat and fish.
                            Cook food to the recommended temperature.
                            Where possible, keep perishable items refrigerated or frozen, and pay attention to product expiry dates.
                            Aim to recycle or dispose of food waste and packaging in an appropriate and sanitary manner, avoiding build-up of refuse
                            which could attract pests.
                            Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before eating and make sure your children do the same.
                            Always use clean utensils and plates.</p>
